# CMinus (C-) Compiler for ZAFx32 processor architecture

Project of a LALR(1) C- (C Minus) compiler designed for a specific architecture (MIPS based), using flex and bison as parse generator (analysis phase).

The synthesis phase (intermediate code, assembly and binary code generators), were implemented separately.

* The Processor project can be find [here](https://github.com/LZafiro/32-bits-MIPS-Based-Processor).

The project was developed for some laboratories of the undergraduate course in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo.

# How To 

First of all you must install gcc, flex and bison:

```sh
sudo apt upadate
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install bison
```
In project directory. To compile/re-compile the compiler, type:

```sh
sh compileTheCompiler.sh
```
To compile, you must write yout programm to a .txt file (input_file.txt), and type:

```sh
./cmin input_file.txt
```

The compiler generates a few files in the 'outputs' directory:

- tokenList.txt
- symbolTable.txt
- syntaxTree.txt
- intermediateCode.txt
- assemblyCode.txt
- binaryCodeWithComments.txt
- rawBinaryCode.txt

# Specifications

## Lexycal Conventions for C-

### Key Words
    
    else, if, while, int, return, void

### Symbols
    
    '+' '-' '*' '/' '<' '<=' '>' '>=' '==' '!=' '=' ';' ',' '{' '}' '(' ')' '[' ']' '/*' '*/';

### Regular Expressions

    ID = letter letter*
    NUM = digit digit*
    leter = a|...|z|A|...|Z
    digit = 0|...|9

There are differences between upper and lower case. 

The comments are composed by:

## Backus-Naur Form (BNF) Grammar for C-

    1.  programm -> declaration-list
    2.  declaration_list -> declaration_list declaration|declaration
    3.  declaration -> var_declaration|fun_declaration
    4.  var_declaration -> type_specifier ID ;|type_specifier [ NUM ]  ;
    5.  type_specifier -> INT | VOID
    6.  fun_declaration -> type_specifier ID ( params ) composed_decl
    7.  params-> param_list | VOID
    8.  param_list -> param_list , param | param
    9.  param -> type_especifier ID | type_especifier ID [ ]
    10. compost_decl -> { local_declarations statement_list }
    11. local_declarations -> local_declarations var_declaration | empty
    12. statement_list -> statement_list statement | empty
    13. statement -> exp_decl | compost_decl | selection_decl | iter_decl | return_decl
    14. exp_decl -> expression ; | ;
    15. selection_decl -> IF ( expression ) statement | IF ( expression ) statement ELSE statement
    16. iter_decl -> WHILE ( expression ) statement
    17. return_decl -> RETURN ; | RETURN expression ;
    18. expression -> var = epression | simple_expression
    19. var -> ID | ID [ expression ]
    20. simple_expressoin -> sum_expression relational sum_expression | sum_expression
    21. relational -> <= | < | > | >= | == | !=
    22. sum_expression -> sum_expression sum term | term
    23. sum -> + | -
    24. term -> term mult factor | factor
    25. mult -> * | /
    26. factor -> ( expression ) | var | activation | NUM4
    27. activation -> ID ( args )
    28. args -> arg_list | empty
    29. arg_list -> arg_list , expression | expression

Also there are two pre-defined global functions:

```C
int input(void){ ... }

void output(int x){ ... }
```
# Tests

Here are presented a test code, with the  intermediate code, assembly code and binaries code, the other outputs, as well as the ones that are presented next, can be found in the 'outputs' directory:

## Code

```C
/* Test code for C- compiler
 * For ZAFx32 Processor */

int vet[10];

int minloc(int a[], int low, int high){
    int i;
    int x;
    int k;
    
    k = low;
    x = a[low];
    i = low + 1;
    
    while(i < high){
        if(a[i] < x){
            x = a[i];
            k = i;
        }
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return k;
}

void sort(int a[], int low, int high){
    int i;
    int k;

    i = low;

    while(i < high - 1){
        int t;
        k = minloc(a, i, high);
        t = a[k];
        a[k] = a[i];
        a[i] = t;
        i = i + 1;
    }
}

void main(void){
    int i;

    i = 0;

    while(i < 10){
        vet[i] = input();
        i = i + 1;
    }
    sort(vet, 0, 10);
    i = 0;
    while(i < 10){
        output(vet[i]);
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
```
